    "## Main task\n",
    "The overall project goal is to reproduce various results in a paper: [*Rigorous constraints on three-nucleon forces in chiral effective field theory from fast and accurate calculations of few-body observables*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04441).  It's a long, scientific paper so don't try to read all of it!  Sec. II of the paper is the most relevant, but you don't need to understand all of it. We'll guide you to the important parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Don't expect to exactly reproduce the results in the paper. We will be using a slightly different model, and make some additional approximations, compared to the study by Wesolowski et al. Differences will be larger for the values of inferred parameters than they will be for physical observables."

    "### General modeling and project description\n",
    "In this project you are faced with a very general scenario for scientific modeling. You have a physics model with a number of unknown parameters. The model outputs can be compared with observed data. Your task is to infer the model parameters given a set of experimental data while taking your knowledge about sources of uncertainty into account. After checking the consistency of the analysis, the calibrated model can then be used for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is implemented on a computer and is costly to evaluate. In a more general scientific setting, this computer implemented model is known as a **simulator**. The computational complexity can sometimes be reduced by model-order reduction. The general idea is to construct an **emulator** that mimics the output of the simulator. The emulator will usually have smaller precision but can be evaluated at a fraction of the computational cost. Having access to a reduced-order model enables a much richer palette of statistical analyses and computer-aided experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular project, you are modeling the properties of atomic nuclei starting from chiral effective field theory. Specifically, the model can be used to compute the binding energies ($E$) of $^3$H, $^3$He, $^4$He, the (point-proton) radius ($R_p$) of $^4$He and the comparative beta-decay halflife ($fT$) of $^3$H. You have access to experimental data for these observables, as well as some knowledge of the relevant sources of uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "The unknown parameters of the model correspond to certain terms in the effective-field theory description of the strong force. They are labeled $c_D$ and $c_E$. Your task is to perform Bayesian parameter estimation and model checking. Important ingredients of this analysis will be to assess the information content of the different data and the incorporation of both experimental uncertainties and theoretical ones. For the extra task you will explore the main theoretical uncertainty, the so called modeling discrepancy term, in more detail."

    "### Physics background\n",
    "(This part with the subsections on chiral EFT, many-body theory and eigenvector continuation, is supplied to provide the physics motivation and background for the study. You don't need to include any of this background context in your project report.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling of hadronic systems, such as atomic nuclei, involves a theoretical description of the strong interaction. At a very fundamental level, such a description involves quarks and gluons within a type of quantum field theory known as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This is included in the standard model of particle physics. However, at low energies, quarks condense into hadrons and the fully resolved QCD description becomes intractable. An effective theory can be constructed in which neutrons, protons (and possibly other hadrons) are used as effective degrees of freedom. The most general interaction between these particles, consistent with the symmetries of the underlying theory, can be formulated using the framework of effective field theory (EFT). In this project we are using a physics model based on a so called chiral EFT, which utilizes the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of QCD. \n",
    "\n",
    "Important, general aspects of EFTs are:\n",
    "- An infinite number of interaction diagrams can be generated. However, they can be ordered by importance using a so called power counting. This gives an EFT expansion for which $Q$, the expansion parameter, is an important property as it sets the convergence rate.\n",
    "- Many diagrams are associated with unknown parameters, so called low-energy constants (LECs), that must be inferred.\n",
    "- Predictions can be made at a certain truncation of the EFT expansion. Such model predictions will be associated with a truncation error. This modeling uncertainty can be quantified using our knowledge of the EFT expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chiral EFT for nuclei\n",
    "Atomic nuclei can be modeled as strongly interacting, quantum many-body systems. Using a non-relativistic approximation, the truncated chiral EFT description gives an interaction potential\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V^k(\\vec\\theta) = V^k_{N\\!N}(\\vec\\theta_{N\\!N}) + V^k_{3N}(\\vec\\theta_{3N}) + \\ldots,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $k$ is the chiral expansion order, $\\vec\\theta$ is the vector of LECs (model parameters), and the unresolved short-distance physics leads to the appearance of irreducible higher-body forces. In this particular case, we will be considering a scenario where we are operating at $k=3$, known as next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), at which three-nucleon forces appear for the first time. We will also make the simplifying assumption that LECs associated with two-nucleon diagrams have already been inferred to infinite precision. This implies that the parameters $\\vec\\theta_{N\\!N}$ are known, but that $\\vec\\theta_{3N}$ remains to be determined. The parameter vector $\\vec\\theta_{3N}$ consists of two LECs that are known as $(c_D, c_E)$. The analysis performed in Wesolowski's paper is more involved as it includes a prior uncertainty in $\\vec\\theta_{N\\!N}$. This will not be considered here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solving the nuclear many-body problem \n",
    "We are interested in solving the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation $H \\Psi = E \\Psi$ for a many-body system. The Hamiltonian will contain the chiral EFT potential plus kinetic energy terms. The eigenvalue $E$ corresponds to the total energy of the system, whereas expectation values of other operators give further observables such as radii and transition strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution of the many-body Schrödinger equation can be approached by constructing a single-particle basis and using the formalism of second quantization to obtain a basis for the many-body system under consideration. Projecting the Hamiltonian operator on this (high-dimensional) basis leads to a large-scale eigenvalue problem that can be solved iteratively. For the few-nucleon systems considered here the Hamiltonian matrix can be of size $N \\times N$ with $N \\approx 10^5$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Eigenvector continuation emulators\n",
    "Using an eigensolver developed at Chalmers, the lowest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates of $A=3,4$ systems can be found using Lanczos diagonalization in $\\approx 60$ seconds. While this is good, it is still not enough for a statistical analysis in which you would like to change parameter values and solve the problem repeatedly. In this project you will be using a reduced-order model that mimics the full solution in just a fraction of the time (milliseconds rather than minutes). It relies on a technique known as eigenvector continuation (EC) that finds an optimal basis and translates the large-scale ($N \\approx 10^5$) eigenvalue problem into a small-scale ($N_{EC} \\approx 10$) generalized eigenvalue problem. The emulators are described in Sec. III.B of the paper with some relevant references for the interested reader. Again, there is no need to include any of this in your report."
