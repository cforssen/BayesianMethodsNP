# Preparations
1. Lecture notes
   - Should be accessible via [https://cforssen.gitlab.io/learningfromdata/](https://cforssen.gitlab.io/learningfromdata/).
   - This is a Jupyter Book for which the source material is available in a gitlab repository. 
     Alternatively, you can download individual chapters in various formats. 
     Some chapters are based on Jupyter Notebooks that you can download and play with yourself.
   - The set of notes is quite extensive and also covers more traditional machine learning
     (including neural networks and Gaussian processes).
   - In this lecture series we will focus on the Bayesian parts with a nuclear-physics perspective.
   - The notes will be updated. Some chapters are still work in progress.
1. Reading guide
   - For a reminder on statistics concepts, see chapter 6.
   - The first lectures will focus on the "Bayesian methods for scientific computing" part.
   - We will use python for the exercise sessions. You are welcome to test your python 
     skills with the exercise notebooks in the Introduction part.
1. Python environment
   - See the [installation instructions](install.md).
